abstract = {The goal of this paper is to investigate an action language, called mA⁎, for representing and reasoning about actions and change in multi-agent domains. The language, as designed, can also serve as a specification language for epistemic planning, thereby addressing an important issue in the development of multi-agent epistemic planning systems. The mA⁎ action language is a generalization of the single-agent action languages, extensively studied in the literature, to the case of multi-agent domains. The language allows the representation of different types of actions that an agent can perform in a domain where many other agents might be present—such as world-altering actions, sensing actions, and communication actions. The action language also allows the specification of agents' dynamic awareness of action occurrences—which has implications on what agents' know about the world and other agents' knowledge about the world. These features are embedded in a language that is simple, yet powerful enough to address a large variety of knowledge manipulation scenarios in multi-agent domains. The semantics of mA⁎ relies on the notion of state, which is described by a pointed Kripke model and is used to encode the agents' knowledge1 and the real state of the world. The semantics is defined by a transition function that maps pairs of actions and states into sets of states. The paper presents a number of properties of the action theories and relates mA⁎ to other relevant formalisms in the area of reasoning about actions in multi-agent domains.}

abstract = {In this work, we formulated the named entity recognition (NER) task as a multi-answer knowledge guided question-answer task (KGQA) and showed that the knowledge guidance helps to achieve state-of-the-art results for 11 of 18 biomedical NER datasets. We prepended five different knowledge contexts—entity types, questions, definitions, and examples—to the input text and trained and tested BERT-based neural models on such input sequences from a combined dataset of the 18 different datasets. This novel formulation of the task (a) improved named entity recognition and illustrated the impact of different knowledge contexts, (b) reduced system confusion by limiting prediction to a single entity-class for each input token (i.e., B, I, O only) compared to multiple entity-classes in traditional NER (i.e., Bentity1, Bentity2, Ientity1, I, O), (c) made detection of nested entities easier, and (d) enabled the models to jointly learn NER-specific features from a large number of datasets. We performed extensive experiments of this KGQA formulation on the biomedical datasets, and through the experiments, we showed when knowledge improved named entity recognition. We analyzed the effect of the task formulation, the impact of the different knowledge contexts, the multi-task aspect of the generic format, and the generalization ability of KGQA. We also probed the model to better understand the key contributors for these improvements.},

    abstract = "Successful application of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is largely limited by the availability of a robust and general purpose natural language parser. Even though several projects have been launched in the pursuit of developing a universal meaning representation language, the existence of an accurate universal parser is far from reality. This has severely limited the application of knowledge representation and reasoning (KR) in the field of NLP and also prevented a proper evaluation of KR based NLU systems. Our goal is to build KR based systems for Natural Language Understanding without relying on a parser. Towards this we propose a method named Deeply Embedded Knowledge Representation {\&} Reasoning (DeepEKR) where we replace the parser by a neural network, soften the symbolic representation so that a deterministic mapping exists between the parser neural network and the interpretable logical form, and finally replace the symbolic solver by an equivalent neural network, so the model can be trained end-to-end. We evaluate our method with respect to the task of Qualitative Word Problem Solving on the two available datasets (QuaRTz and QuaRel). Our system achieves same accuracy as that of the state-of-the-art accuracy on QuaRTz, outperforms the state-of-the-art on QuaRel and severely outperforms a traditional KR based system. The results show that the bias introduced by a KR solution does not prevent it from doing a better job at the end task. Moreover, our method is interpretable due to the bias introduced by the KR approach.",
